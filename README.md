This fashion recommendation system leverages a pre-trained VGG16 model to analyze and extract features from fashion images. By calculating cosine similarity between the features of an input image and a database of images, the system recommends visually similar fashion items. The project utilizes deep learning for feature extraction and content-based image retrieval to provide personalized fashion suggestions.
